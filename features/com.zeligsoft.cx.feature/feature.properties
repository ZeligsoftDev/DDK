interest (including, without limitation, all copyright and patent rights)\n\
in and to the Product and any Derivative Work thereof provided in\n\
conjunction with this. Customer shall gain no right, title or interest\n\
therein by virtue of this Agreement other than the non-exclusive right to\n\

Products and in accordance with this Agreement.\n\
\n\
B.	Infringement Indemnity. PrismTech Canada shall defend and indemnify\n\
Customer and will pay the costs and damages finally awarded against\n\
Customer in any action to the extent that it is based on a claim that the\n\
use by Customer of the Product(s) furnished by PrismTech Canada infringes any\n\
Canadian or United States patent or copyright, provided that Customer\n\
notifies PrismTech Canada within ten (10) days of the existence of the claim,\n\

and provides all such assistance as PrismTech Canada may reasonably require. \n\
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this indemnification obligation shall not\n\

The foregoing states the entire liability of PrismTech Canada and Customer's\n\
exclusive remedy with respect to any intellectual or industrial property\n\
infringement.\n\
\n\
C.	Hazardous Uses Prohibition. Customer acknowledges that the Products\n\
are intended for standard commercial uses.  They must not be used in any\n\
hazardous environments requiring fail safe performance, such as in the\n\
operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication\n\
systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons\n\
systems, in which the failure of the Products could lead directly to death,\n\
personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. The Customer\n\
hereby agrees that the use of the Products for any such application without\n\
the prior written consent of PrismTech Canada, shall be at the Customer's sole\n\
risk.  The Customer also agrees to defend and hold PrismTech Canada and its\n\
licensors harmless from any claims for loss, cost, damage, expense or\n\
liability that may arise out of or in connection with the use of the\n\
Products in such applications.\n\
\n\
4.	PAYMENT.\n\
\n\
A.	Fees. Customer shall pay the License Fees within 30 days of the\n\
date of our invoice to Customer.\n\
\n\
B.	Taxes. Customer is responsible for payment of all duties and\n\
foreign, federal, state, county, local income taxes, value-added taxes and\n\
other taxes, or amounts in lieu thereof, and interest thereon levied or\n\
based on amounts chargeable to or payable by Customer (excluding taxes on\n\
PrismTech Canada's net income). In the event any payments required to be made by\n\
Customer are subject to applicable withholding tax that Customer is\n\
required to deduct from such payments, Customer shall promptly provide us\n\
with receipts issued by appropriate government authorities for all such\n\
taxes withheld or paid by Customer and Customer will fully and promptly\n\
cooperate with us (at our expense) to provide such information and records\n\
as we may require in connection with any application by us to obtain\n\
available tax credits.\n\
\n\
C.	Late Payment.  If Customer's payments to us are more than thirty\n\
(30) days in arrears, we will give Customer written notice that Customer is\n\
responsible for payment of all outstanding amounts and finance charges. If\n\
the outstanding amounts are not paid within ten (10) days of this notice,\n\
we have the right to (i) suspend Customer's licenses until all amounts are\n\
paid in full or such breach is remedied to our satisfaction; and (ii)\n\
terminate this Agreement. Customer shall pay all costs including reasonable\n\
attorney's fees, incurred by us in collecting overdue amounts.  Further, we\n\
will not be required to issue to Customer any new license in the event\n\
Customer's account is in arrears.\n\
\n\
D.	Currency. All payments to PrismTech Canada, and all amounts referred to in\n\
this Agreement, are in the currency of the United States of America.\n\
\n\
E.	Product and Fee Changes. During the term of this Agreement, we may\n\
elect to change the Products, programs or fees, and/or terms of use for the\n\
purpose of either: (i) adding software products made available in the\n\
ordinary course; or (ii) reflecting our then current policies and\n\
procedures and license fee structures. However, any such change to license\n\
fees shall apply only to Product licenses purchased after the date of such\n\
change. The License Fees do not include support and maintenance. Support\n\
and maintenance is available upon payment of a separate support and\n\
maintenance fee and is provided in accordance with PrismTech Canada's then current\n\
support and maintenance terms and conditions. Fees for support and\n\
maintenance may be changed by us from time to time and Customer will be\n\
required to pay the then current fee for support and maintenance at the\n\
time of renewal of the support and maintenance contract. \n\
\n\
5.	CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\
\n\
A.	Confidential Information. From time to time each of us may have\n\
access to information of the other and each party agrees to keep\n\
confidential such any and all information with respect to the other party\n\
which it has received or may in future receive in connection with this\n\
Agreement, which shall include without limitation, the terms and conditions\n\
of this Agreement, the Products, and any information with respect to the\n\
products or pricing that we may provided to Customer from time to time (the\n\
"Confidential Information") and shall only disclose such information (i) to\n\
its agents, employees or representatives who have a need to know such\n\
information, for the purpose of performance under this Agreement and\n\
exercising the rights granted under this Agreement and who have entered\n\
into a non-disclosure agreement at least as protective of the disclosing\n\
party's confidential information as this Agreement, or (ii) to the extent\n\
required by applicable law or during the course of or in connection with\n\
any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding based upon or in connection\n\
with the subject matter of this Agreement, provided that the receiving\n\
party shall give the disclosing party reasonable notice prior to such\n\
disclosure and shall comply with any applicable protective order or\n\
equivalent.\n\
\n\
B.	Further Treatment of Confidential Information.  Each of us agrees\n\
to hold all Confidential Information in trust and confidence for the other\n\
and not to use same other than as expressly authorized under this\n\
Agreement. We each agree not to disclose any such Confidential Information\n\
without the prior written consent of the non-disclosing party, to anyone\n\
other than as permitted in paragraph 5 (A). Each party agrees to protect\n\
the other party's Confidential Information with the same standard of care\n\
and procedures which it uses to protect its own trade secrets and\n\
Confidential Information of like importance and, in any event, will adopt\n\
or maintain procedures reasonably calculated to protect such Confidential\n\
Information. \n\
\n\
C.	Equitable Relief. In recognition of the unique and confidential\n\
nature of the information disclosed by each of us, it is agreed that each\n\
party's remedy for breach by the other party of its obligations under this\n\
section will be inadequate and the non-disclosing party will, in the event\n\
of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including without\n\
limitation, injunctive relief and specific performance, in addition to any\n\
other remedies provided hereunder or available at law.\n\
\n\
D.	Customer Reference.  PrismTech Canada may, at its discretion, reference\n\
Customer's name as customer in PrismTech Canada marketing efforts.\n\
\n\
6.	TERM AND TERMINATION. \n\
\n\
A.	Term and Termination. This Agreement shall remain in effect only\n\
for so long as Customer is in compliance with its terms and conditions.\n\
Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for cause\n\
upon thirty (30) calendar days written notice if the other party is in\n\
material breach any of its obligations under this Agreement and thereafter\n\
fail to cure such breach within such 30 day period.\n\
\n\
B.	Effects of Termination: Upon termination, Customer shall\n\
immediately: (i) purge all Products from all computer systems, servers,\n\
terminals, personal computers, storage media, and any and all other devices\n\
and files with which the Product is used; (ii) return to PrismTech Canada all\n\
copies (including partial copies) of the Product and any related\n\
documentation; (iii) if requested by PrismTech Canada, certify to PrismTech Canada in\n\
writing that Customer has complied with the foregoing obligations and have\n\
not provided total or partial copies of the Product or documentation to any\n\
third party;  and (iv) remit all payments due and owing hereunder. Further,\n\
each of us shall return or destroy (at the disclosing party's option) all\n\
Confidential Information, and all copies, summaries or extracts thereof.\n\
\n\
C.	Survival. The following sections of this Agreement shall survive\n\
any termination of this Agreement for any reason:, 3 (A) and (C), 4 (A) and\n\
(B), 5, 6 (B)  and (C), 7(B) and (C) and 8.\n\
\n\
7.	LIMITATION OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY.\n\
\n\
A.	Warranties.  PrismTech Canada warrants that the Product will perform\n\
substantially in accordance with the Documentation or other specifications\n\
published by PrismTech Canada for a period of 30 days from the date of the receipt\n\
of the Product by the Customer. PrismTech Canada does not warrant, however, that\n\
the Customer's use of the Product will be uninterrupted, that the operation\n\
of the Product will be error-free, that the Product will meet the\n\
Customer's requirements or that all errors will be corrected. If during the\n\
warranty period, as defined above, the Product fails to perform in\n\
accordance with the warranty, PrismTech Canada shall use reasonable commercial\n\
efforts to correct the failure of the Product to perform in accordance with\n\
the warranty. If PrismTech Canada is unable to correct the failure within a\n\
reasonable time, PrismTech Canada shall refund the purchase price of the Product.\n\
PrismTech Canada also warrants that the media on which the Product is encoded will\n\
be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and\n\
service for a period of one year from date of receipt. PrismTech Canada shall, at\n\
its option, repair or replace any defective media of which it is given\n\
notice during the one-year period. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT ABOVE, THERE\n\
ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\n\
NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY,\n\
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT\n\
OR THOSE ARISING BY LAW, STATUTE, USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE OF DEALING OR\n\
OTHERWISE. CUSTOMER ASSUMES THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE RESULTS AND\n\
PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT AND WE ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY\n\
WITH RESPECT THERETO.  \n\
\n\
B.	Limitation of Liability.  NEITHER WE NOR OUR LICENSORS, DEALERS OR\n\
SUPPLIERS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR\n\
ENTITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n\
WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUE OR PROFIT, LOST\n\
OR DAMAGED DATA OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN\n\
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR THEY ARE FORESEEABLE. WE ARE\n\
ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CLAIMS BY A THIRD PARTY. OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE\n\
LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER AND THAT OF OUR DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT\n\
EXCEED THE LICENSE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE PRODUCT GIVING RISE TO THE\n\
CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT THE\n\
ALLEGED BREACH OR DEFAULT IS A BREACH OF A FUNDAMENTAL CONDITION OR TERM OR\n\
A FUNDAMENTAL BREACH.  \n\
\n\
C.	Fundamental Terms.  The limited warranty, exclusive remedies and\n\
limited liability set out herein are fundamental elements of the basis of\n\
the bargain between us. We would not be able to provide the Products on an\n\
economic basis without such limitations. No agreements varying or extending\n\
the foregoing warranties or limitations will be binding on PrismTech Canada unless\n\
in writing and signed by an authorized signing officer of PrismTech Canada.\n\
\n\
8.	PURCHASE ORDER\n\
\n\
Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Customer and PrismTech Canada, the\n\
acceptance of any Purchase Order placed by Customer for a Product is\n\
expressly made conditional upon Customer's acceptance of and agreement to\n\
the terms and conditions contained herein and in PrismTech Canada's quote relating\n\
to the Product. PrismTech Canada shall furnish the Product(s) only upon these\n\
terms and conditions and not on the terms and conditions contained in the\n\
Customer's Purchase Order. Any terms and conditions contained in the\n\
Purchase Order or other document issued by Customer relating to this\n\
Agreement that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions hereof are\n\
hereby rejected.\n\
\n\
9.	MISCELLANEOUS.\n\
\n\
A.	Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the entire agreement between\n\
us, superseding any other agreement or discussions, oral or written,\n\
including all pre-printed terms and conditions appearing on  order forms,\n\
acknowledgment of order forms and  invoice forms, even if accepted by the\n\
receiving party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if PrismTech Canada and Customer\n\
have entered into a written evaluation license agreement or other license\n\
agreement relating to the Software then the terms and conditions of such\n\
executed license agreement shall govern Customer's use of the Software. \n\
\n\
B.	Governing Law. If Customer is located in the United States, the\n\
laws of the State of New York shall govern this Agreement. If Customer is\n\
located in Canada or outside of North America, the laws of the province of\n\
Ontario shall govern this Agreement. In each case, conflicts of laws\n\
provision and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n\
International Sale of Goods and any legislation implementing such\n\
Convention, if otherwise applicable. \n\
\n\
C.	Modifications. Except for changes permitted pursuant to Section\n\
4(E), any changes or modifications to this Agreement require the mutual\n\
written agreement of each party. No order, invoice or similar document will\n\
affect this Agreement even if accepted by the receiving party.\n\
\n\
D.	Severance. If any provision of this Agreement is declared by a\n\
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable,\n\
such a provision shall be severed from the Agreement, the provision in\n\
question shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable\n\
provision most closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original\n\
provision and the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n\
\n\
E.	No Waiver. A failure by either party to enforce any right under\n\
this Agreement shall not at any time constitute a waiver of such right or\n\
any other right, and shall not modify the rights or obligations of either\n\
party under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to waive\n\
or limit any remedy available to PrismTech Canada at law, including without\n\
limitation any remedy available to PrismTech Canada under Canadian or foreign\n\
copyright laws or international treaties.\n\
\n\
F.	Assignment; Enurement. PrismTech Canada may assign all or any part of this\n\
Agreement, but no assignment or transfer of any interest in this Agreement\n\
(including sublicenses, pledge, security interests, and the like) may be\n\
made by Customer without the prior written consent of PrismTech Canada. In the\n\
event Customer wishes to 'outsource' transfer ownership of the Product,\n\
Customer must first provide written notice to PrismTech Canada of Customer's\n\
intent to do so (including the name and address of the proposed outsourcer)\n\
and may not assign such activities until such time as the organization\n\
providing the outsourcing services has agreed in writing to be bound by and\n\
comply with this Agreement in full. Customer shall at all times remain\n\
fully liable and will indemnify and hold PrismTech Canada harmless from and\n\
against any and all damages arising directly or indirectly from such\n\
outsourcer's activities or failure to comply with this Agreement. This\n\
Agreement shall obligate and benefit the parties, their personal\n\
representatives, heirs, successors, and permitted assigns.\n\
\n\
G.	Force Majeure. No default, delay or failure to perform on the part\n\
of either party shall be considered a breach of these terms if such\n\
default, delay or failure to perform is shown to be due entirely to an\n\
event of force majeure, or to causes beyond the reasonable control of the\n\
defaulting party including without limitation, actions or inactions of\n\
governmental authorities or interruptions of the Internet (such as failure\n\
of a telecommunication service providers or Internet service provider),\n\
always provided that the party so relieved of its obligations hereunder\n\
provides notice to the other party and takes all reasonable and necessary\n\
steps to resume performance of its obligations as soon as possible.\n\
\n\
H.	Language. The original of this Agreement has been written in\n\
English and Customer hereby waives any right Customer may have under the\n\
laws of Customer's territory to have this Agreement written in any other\n\
language. If this Agreement is translated into a language other than\n\
English, the English version and interpretation shall govern and prevail.\n\
All communications between the parties hereunder shall be in English. Les\n\
parties aux pr\u00E9sentes ont exig\u00E9 que cette entente et tous autres documents\n\
envisag\u00E9s par les pr\u00E9sentes soient r\u00E9dig\u00E9s en anglais.\n\
\n\
I.	Export Controls. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is solely\n\
responsible and liable for complying with any applicable import/export\n\
laws, rules and regulations with regard to Customer's acquisition and use\n\
of this Product.\n\
